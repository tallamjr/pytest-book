• **Unit test**: A test that checks a small bit of code, like a function or a class, in isolation of the
rest of the system.

• **Integration test**: A test that checks a larger bit of the code, maybe several classes, or a
subsystem. Mostly it’s a label used for some test larger than a unit test, but smaller than a system
test.

• **System test (end-to-end)**: A test that checks all of the system under test in an environment as
close to the end-user environment as possible.

• **Functional test**: A test that checks a single bit of functionality of a system. A test that checks
how well we add or delete or update a task item in Tasks is a functional test.

• **Subcutaneous test**: A test that does not run against the final end-user interface, but against an
interface just below the surface. Since most of the tests in this book test against the API
layer—not the CLI—they qualify as subcutaneous tests.
